# Homepage Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### What's There Now:

1. **Hero**: "We build software that thinks" + abstract geometric grid
2. **Services**: 3 generic cards (AI Solutions, Business Automation, Custom Development)
3. **Products**: Adfluens, Praxis Notes, Loquent with abstract shape visuals
4. **About**: Values with icons

### Problems:

- ❌ Hero visual is abstract/futuristic - not relatable to target audience
- ❌ No real images of people or businesses
- ❌ Services are generic - don't reflect actual focus (aesthetics, local business)
- ❌ No social proof (client logos, testimonials, case study results)
- ❌ Doesn't speak to specific industries we serve
- ❌ Products have abstract visuals instead of actual screenshots

---

## Image Style Guidelines

### DO:

- Real people in professional settings
- Business owners working, celebrating success
- Clinic professionals with patients (appropriate/professional)
- Local business storefronts, teams
- Clean, modern photography
- Warm, approachable lighting
- Diverse representation
- High quality, professional shots

### DON'T:

- Futuristic/sci-fi imagery
- Abstract tech visuals
- Glowing circuits/neural networks
- Stock photos that feel fake
- Overly corporate/sterile
- Blue-tinted "tech" aesthetics
